## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Edge-Optimized File Delivery

The application implements a sophisticated file delivery system that minimizes costs while maximizing performance:

1.  **Relative Path Storage**: Files are stored with relative paths in the database.
2.  **Dynamic URL Construction**: The frontend builds full CDN URLs on-demand.
3.  **Cloudflare Transform Rules**: Automatic path rewriting provides seamless B2 integration.
4.  **Intelligent Caching**: Files are cached at the edge after the first request.
5.  **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces Backblaze Class B transactions by ~99% through caching.
